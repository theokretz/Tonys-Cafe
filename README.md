# Tony's Cafe


Jesse: All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.
Look, lady, whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, yo.

Skyler: Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
My husband is Walter White, yo.
He told me everything.

Jesse: - Seriously?

Skyler: - That's right.
And just so you know My brother-in-law is a DEA agent.
And I will not hesitate to call him. Not if I have to.
Understood? This is your one and only warning.
Do not sell marijuana to my husband.

Jesse: - Okay?

Skyler: - I mean it.
Don't call our house again.
You stay away from him, or you'll be one sorry individual.
You got me?

Jesse: I think so, yeah.

Skyler: No more marijuana.

Jesse: I can dig it.
Skyler: You can dig it. Wonderful.
Not that it's any of my business,
but you might wanna consider a different line of work.

Jesse: Okay.
